# Bayesian-logistic-regression-model.
This model demonstrates how to use Bayesian logistic regression with simulated data. It begins by installing, loading the necessary package and setting a seed for reproducibility. The data was simulated which consists of 200 data points, with BMI values generated from a normal distribution, and a binary outcome variable (heart disease) generated using a logistic function based on BMI. After visualizing the data, the code sets normal priors for the intercept and slope of the logistic regression model, which links BMI to the probability of heart disease. The model is then fitted and the summary of the model is printed.
